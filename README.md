# GoldHEN Plugin SDK - a PRX hook/patch SDK for Orbis OS

[![Build library check](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_SDK/actions/workflows/build_lib.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_SDK/actions/workflows/build_lib.yml)

This is the GoldHEN Plugin SDK repository.

It requires [OpenOrbis PS4 Toolchain](https://github.com/OpenOrbis/OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain) and [LLVM 10+](https://llvm.org/) to be installed.

## Including the SDK as source

It's better if you copy the SDK source files into your project and build the SDK from source *with* your project,
because there may be some compiler or OpenOrbis Toolchain bugfixes which would require rebuilding the GoldHEN SDK.

Just build all files from `source/` as C source code, and include stuff from `include/`.

## Including the SDK as a static library

If you are sure you won't be rebuilding the GoldHEN SDK, then you can include stuff from `include/`,
run `make` for Linux or `build_static.bat` for Windows to build a static library `libGoldHEN_Hook.a` and then use it in your project for the implementation of the headers.
